# Dayvid's System Library

Hi! This is the repository for my C library with reimplementations of every single C method i would need or want to use, without needing to rewrite everything.

### Modules

This library is splitted in modules, but you can link with all of them. The default is for they to be compiled as static object archive (.a) files.
